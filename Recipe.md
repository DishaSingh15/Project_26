How to make Red Velvet Cake step by step...


Step 1: First prheat your oven to 350 F (176 C). Next let's make our cake better. Start by creaming your butter and your white granulated or caster sugar together in a large bowl. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to do this.

Step 2: Now we add in our eggs one at a time. So drop on gg in, mix, once that egg is completely incorporated do the other egg. Make sure to scrape the slides of the bowl as well with a spatula. 

Step 3: Now we add is our cocoa powder. It is a good idea to run it through some kind of a sifter. Cocoa powder tends to get a bit lumpy. Then mix mix again and scrape the sides as needed. Throughout this whol process we don't want to over mix, just untill things are incorporated. If we mix too much air into the batter which can cause air pockets in our cake.

Step 4: Now add in your vanilla extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vinegar. If you don't have buttermilk you can make  some by taking just shy of one cup of regular milk and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and then let it sit for about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and vanilla extract untill combined.

Step 5: Now we add in our oil to the buttermilk mixture. Next add in stir, untill the mixture is a nice red color. Set that mixture aside for now.

Step 6: Next we will add our salt and baking soda to our flour. You can use cake flour or all-purpose flour. Cake flour tends to work a little bit better, but all-purpose works great too. Use a whisk to combine those ingredients.

Step 7: Next we will ad in about half of our food  colorring buttermilk mixture an about half of our flour mixture, then turn on the mixer and mix untill just combined. Give the sides of the bowl a good scrape, then complete the process untill all ingredients have been mixed leaving you with a nice red velvet cake batter.

Step 8: Now we just fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch cake pans with equal amounts of a cake batter. Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pans and then dust them with cocoa powder or flour. Now bake the cakes for 23 to 30 minutes untill a toothpick come out, clean after poking it in th middle.

Step 9: Now after the cakes come out of the oven let it cool in the pans for about 10 minutes.

The Cake is ready enjoy it!!!!
